Review questions:
1 What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
2 What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
3 How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
4 Name 4 elements that are diplay block by default, 5 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-5 block by default 5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

Answers:
1 The inline element does not take necessary width and do not start up a new line while the block element start up a new line and take  up the full width available from left to right.
2 It adjust relative to its parent position but if the parent position is not relative it adjust with the body.
3 You make it inline.
4 4 elements that are diplay block by default are <div>,<ul>,<section>,<p>.
   5 elements that are display inline by default are <span>,<strong>,<a>,<del>,<i>.
The box model is like a case that wrap or encapsulate an element which are content,padding,border and margin.
The fix for box model are the content,padding,border and margin
